Radria was originally a complex framework with a lot of tools to generate code and web applications.
http://radria.sqlfusion.com/

It was hosted on Sourceforge until they changed my password and never let me recover it.

This new version on github will only be the RadriaCore and a much more simplified version.

Its yet an other PHP framework with less than all the other framework.
Its Model Controler, not view because we use standard PHP for the view.

We may add back some of the tools like the SiteManager or WebIde but for the next couple of month it will only be RadriaCore.

This version of RadriaCore is much more lean and simple as we have removed the XML templates and auto generated views and forms.

I don't have much documentation but created a sample application so you can get a feel of it and get started.

Everything is released under the LGPL

Have fun,
